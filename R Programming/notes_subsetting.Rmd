# Which

Useful to select data meeting a criteria

```{r}
df <- data.frame(c("A", "B", "A", "B"), 1:4)
colnames(df) <- c("Treatment", "Value")
  
  
df[which(df$Treatment == "A"), ] ## Both of these work
df[df$Treatment == "A", ] ## The base subset can infer which?
```

```{r}
df[, "Treatment"]
```


# Cbind and Rbind

Allow you to bind to matrix or data frames together by columns or rows, respectively. 

# Grep for partial matches

grep("wt", colnames(cplanegenes)) ## searches colnames of cplanegenes matrix to find matches to "wt". Returns a logical vector of matches.
